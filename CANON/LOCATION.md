### The Death Location (Specific)
**The Common Room:** A 20x25 foot room with high ceilings (12 feet) and a large arched window. The famous mosaic dominates the east wall - an 8x6 foot Persian-influenced geometric design in blues, greens, and gold. It was installed in 1962 by a French interior designer. Mounted on a concrete backing attached to the old plaster wall with iron brackets. Beneath it: a decorative wooden shelf displaying hostel brochures. The floor is cream-colored cement tile. Water damage from the upstairs bathroom has been seeping into this wall for three years.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Youssef El-Mansouri
**Description:** 45-year-old former tour guide, patient and multilingual. Has worked at the hostel since conversion. Knows every structural problem and has reported them all.
**Role in death:** Warning-giver - explicitly told Margot not to stand too close

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Fatima | Avoids the common room; says the wall "feels wrong" |
| Cook | Hassan | Margot's breakfast was his last meal she ate |
| Manager | Pierre Dubois | French expat owner; prioritizes aesthetics over maintenance |
| Handyman | None | Budget doesn't allow; Youssef does basic repairs |

### Staff Knowledge
Youssef has filed multiple maintenance reports about the wall. Pierre dismissed them as "alarmist." After the death, Pierre claims he never received any reports.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Peaceful courtyard relaxation. Guests reading, working on laptops. Sound of fountain. Mint tea service mid-morning.

### Night Vibe
Social but calm. Rooftop conversations. Some guests head to the medina for nightlife. Quiet hours actually enforced.

### Guest Demographics
Cultural travelers, young Europeans, photography enthusiasts, solo female travelers (feels safe), the occasional boomer couple wanting "authentic" experience.

### Reputation
TripAdvisor: 4.2 stars - "Beautiful traditional riad, stunning common room, some maintenance issues"
Lonely Planet mention: "The mosaic alone is worth a night's stay"

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Marrakech riads are often centuries old with significant structural concerns. Water damage is common. The medina is a UNESCO site with strict renovation rules that are inconsistently enforced.

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Respect Islamic culture in depiction
- Avoid "mysterious Orient" tropes
- Show Moroccan characters as fully realized people
- Note that Moroccan hospitality may soften safety warnings

### Sources
- Architectural studies of Marrakech riads
- News reports on building collapses in old medinas
- Interior design history of mid-century Morocco
- Insurance industry data on wall-mounted art accidents
